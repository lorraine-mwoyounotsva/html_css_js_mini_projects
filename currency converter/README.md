# Currency Converter

A simple Currency Converter web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time exchange rates from an external API to convert an amount from one currency to another.

## How it works

- On page load, the app fetches the list of available currencies from the exchange rate API.
- Users input the amount and select the source and target currencies.
- Upon submitting the form, the app fetches the latest exchange rate for the chosen currencies.
- The converted amount is calculated and displayed dynamically on the page.
- Proper validation is included to handle invalid amounts or unavailable rates.

## What I learned

- How to work with **fetch API** and async/await for asynchronous data fetching.
- Manipulating the DOM to dynamically populate `<select>` options.
- Handling form submissions and input validation in JavaScript.
- Using **CSS gradients** and pastel colors for modern UI styling.
- Structuring code cleanly across separate files for HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Adding user-friendly feedback and error handling for better UX.

This project helped me improve my skills in asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and responsive, clean UI design.

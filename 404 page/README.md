# 404 Page - "Oops! Page Not Found"

This is a minimal and modern 404 error page created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It's designed to be friendly, responsive, and visually appealing, helping users gracefully handle broken or non-existent links.

## Features

- Custom illustration (replace `404.jpg` with your own image)
- Friendly headline and description
- “Back to Home” button with hover effects
- Clean layout using Flexbox
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## What I Learned

- Centering content with Flexbox (`align-items`, `justify-content`)
- Making responsive designs using media queries
- Using accessible color contrast and semantic HTML
- Creating hover effects with `transition`
- Writing a clean, readable HTML and CSS structure

This project was a great way to practice layout techniques and communicate technical errors in a more human way.

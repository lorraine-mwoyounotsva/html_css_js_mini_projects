# HTML, CSS & JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my little web dev playground, a growing collection of **mini projects** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These are just fun, focused projects Iâ€™ve created to sharpen my front-end development skills and explore new ideas.
These bite-sized projects helped me explore new concepts, master tricky parts of the front-end coding, and have fun experimenting with UI elements. 

## Why I Did This

I wanted to:

- Stay consistent with daily coding
- Practice real-world components and logic
- Build a portfolio of interactive front-end pieces
- Challenge myself creatively and technically

No frameworks. No libraries. Just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What You'll Find

Each folder is a self-contained project nothing too fancy, just clean, creative, and fun components that run right in the browser.
